        <h2>Welcome to Henry's Woodworking!</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Henry's Woodworking was first established in 1975 by Henry Steinberg. Henry is a third generation woodworker
        and therefore grew up working in his father's woodshop. He has always been passionate about the art of
        woodwork. He knew from a young age that he would make this passion into his profession. He worked hard in his
            early twenties to save enough money to open his very own shop! He always knew he never wanted to work for
            anyone else, so he had to not only master the art of woodworking but of entrepreneurship, as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            After a few years of being miserable working for million dollar corrporatians, he met his now wife Sandra who
            convinced him to follow his dreams and open his own company. With his love of wood work and Sandras
            background in business mangagment he was finally ready to follow his dreams. Today Henry's woodworking
            Provides you with high quality woodworking with a pleasent family like attmispher, as we say "If its wood
            its good".
